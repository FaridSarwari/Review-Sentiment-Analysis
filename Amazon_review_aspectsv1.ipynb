       "  \"Cool! Not so expensive! It is a famous pedro max, but there are relatively few people who use it. Size that is easy to use even solo. The bottom is flat, so you can use it with IH. I can't list what I like. It's definitely better than buying the expensive one that many domestic manufacturers use.\"],\n",

       " 'design': [\"I wanted to cook with whole chicken, so I bought a slightly larger FT6. I thought that it was a little deep for this diameter, but it seems to serve its purpose sufficiently. Of course, both the body and lid are very heavy. However, I think that this weight is the reason why it is a Dutch oven of a Dutch oven, so it seems that it will do a solid job. I'm looking forward to using the lid as an iron plate. Since it is solid and heavy, I think it is better to prepare a special case or a durable fabric container such as canvas for carrying. Oil that seems to be anti-rust is firmly applied. I don't know what kind of oil it is, so I need to rinse it thoroughly with detergent when seasoning. In particular, oil may accumulate in the grooves of the pattern part of the lid, so you may have to put detergent on the turtle scourer and rub it off. Overall, I think it was a good purchase.\",\n",
       "  \"It is the best dish for camping for one or two people. It is heavy, but this feeling of weight is a sign of a good product. I'm looking forward to it because it will taste even more if you use it. I think it is safe to use even for beginners. Since I am also a beginner.\",\n",
       "  'The size is suitable for the serving size of 2-3 people. It is easy to use and the lid can be used as a skillet. Since it has feet on the lid, it is stable even if you put it on firewood or charcoal. Plus, I like the design.',\n",
       "  \"I used it twice in my solo camp. Both vegetables and meat are tender and look cool, so I recommend it. To clean it, just scrub it dry with a scourer and grease it with oil. I don't think it's that troublesome.  The following is prejudice. It's just my personal opinion, but I don't need a solo Dutch oven in the first place. First of all, it's just heavy! It is difficult to transport. I thought that Dutch ovens have a way of making camp cooking exciting. For a solo, an aluminum cooker is enough. If it is more than 3 people, it is too small, so I think a 2 person camp is best. I think it's best to use it like that with a lover or as a couple.\",\n",
       "  \"I have a 10-inch one, but I bought it because I wanted a small one for solo.  The size is listed, but when I look at the actual one, I have the impression that it is quite small. But it's well made and the lid is stylish. I like it.  If you cook with 300cc straight soup base and ingredients, it will be just the right amount. I guess it's enough for two people. (I wonder if it can cook up to 400cc) I bought a tote bag and lid of the size that I will meet at a home center.\",\n",
       "  \"Purchased for solo. I'm surprised that the lid is heavier than the main body! LODEG's lid for 6 1/2 inches is a miracle fit! The reverse is also true! For the bottom net, Nitori's skillet pot 6-inch bottom net is perfect! I'm looking forward to camping.\",\n",

Also, the pattern on the lid was very cool, and I remembered the dragon sword key chain I bought on a school trip and the bad souvenir bun, that bright girl who asked me to look at it with me, and myself on that day when I was whispered and ran away.'],\n",
